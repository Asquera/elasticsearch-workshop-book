# Elasticsearch Setup

In order to follow the examples it is recommended to run an Elasticsearch instance. Most examples only require a single instance. There are multiple ways to set up an environment.


## Docker Compose (recommended)

The recommended way is to use the same environment as used in the presentations, available at the Github repository [Asquera/elasticsearch-docker](https://github.com/Asquera/elasticsearch-docker). This setup uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to start Elasticsearch (and other containers).

To set up the same environment:

* âœ… [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system
  * **Note** the Windows installation includes Compose
* âœ… in case the installation does not include **Compose**, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once installed, checkout the repository from Github:

âœ… Use `git` to checkout the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asquera/elasticsearch-docker.git
```

this project also includes a [Readme](https://github.com/Asquera/elasticsearch-docker/blob/main/Readme.md) with instructions on how to use the setup.

âœ… Change to the `elasticsearch-docker` folder.

âœ… Start a single Elasticsearch instance by running the command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build elasticsearch01
```

This starts the Elasticsearch container named **elasticsearch01**, which is part of the environment. This may take a few minutes, there is also log output on stdout. Once started, the Elasticsearch instance is accessible at [localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200). You may need to open another shell to access it or add the option `--detach` (or short `-d`) to the `docker-compose` command to start the instance in detached mode.

> **ðŸ”Ž** The repository contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines multiple other containers for different setups, e.g. ELK stack that is useful for some scenarios.


## Docker

An alternative way to set up the environment with a single Elasticsearch Docker container requires only [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). 

âœ… In case Docker is not installed [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

Once installed the following command downloads the official Elasticsearch Docker image.

âœ… Enter the following command into your terminal:

```shell
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.8.1
```

This downloads, unpacks and starts the official Elasticsearch Docker image (verion `7.8.1`). This starts the Elasticsearch instance and forwards ports `9200` and `9300`. Once started the Elasticsearch instance is accessible at [localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200). You may need to open another shell to access it.


## VM

There also ways to set up an Elasticsearch either locally (e.g. Virtual Box, vagrant) or remotely at a cloud provider. This may require manual installation of Elasticsearch, but the principle is similar.
