# Search

Elasticsearch provides a full [Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html) (Domain Specific Language) to define search queries. There is an exhaustive list of available query types. 

> **Note**, it's not necessarily feasible to know all of the different query types, more importantly it's better to learn what query capabilities Elasticsearch has to offer and focus on your use cases.
