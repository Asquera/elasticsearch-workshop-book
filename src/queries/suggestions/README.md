# Completions & Suggesters

There are a number of special search queries to help users navigate the document space. These are mostly applied when the user enters text into search input field or a text box, where multiple suggestions appear shortly after.

* [Completion](./completion.md) - using `completion` field type & `ngram` based analyzer
* [Did You Mean Suggest](./did_you_mean.md) - using `suggest` query
* [Search As You Type](./search_as_you_type.md) - using `search_as_you_type` field type & custom `analyzer`
* [Context Suggester](./context_suggestions.md) - using `completion` field type with context information
