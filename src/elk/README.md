# Elastic Stack

This chapter is about the Elastic Stack consisting of the frameworks [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html), [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html) and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html), comprising the **ELK** stack. Since a few years this is accompanied by the [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats/) family, most notably [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/index.html) as a lightweight log shipper and [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/index.html) a metrics shipper.

These ELK or Elastic components are typically used to set up a logging / analytics infrastructure for distributed systems. It acts a central service for the infrastructure.
